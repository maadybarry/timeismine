## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose  
The purpose of this document is to define the functional, non-functional, and technical specifications for an AI-assisted to-do list application that helps users manage their time more effectively using artificial intelligence.

### 1.2 Scope  
The system allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks. It uses AI to analyze task priorities, predict task durations, suggest optimal schedules, and adapt over time based on user behavior and calendar availability.

### 1.3 Intended Audience  
- Developers  
- Product managers  
- AI/ML engineers  
- QA testers  
- End users (for documentation clarity)

## 2. System Overview

An intelligent productivity application that provides a to-do list with:
- Smart prioritization
- AI-based scheduling
- Productivity suggestions
- Calendar integration
- Behavioral learning

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 User Authentication
- Register / Login / Logout
- OAuth 2.0 with Google (for calendar access)

### 3.2 Task Management
- Add/Edit/Delete tasks
- Set due dates and estimated durations
- Assign tags (work, personal, etc.)
- Set priorities (high, medium, low)

### 3.3 AI Features
- **Smart Prioritization**: Based on urgency, importance, duration, and context
- **Time Suggestions**: Recommend when to do tasks based on calendar + productivity patterns
- **Adaptive Suggestions**: Learn from user behavior to improve future suggestions
- **Natural Language Input**: Parse plain English task inputs (e.g., ‚ÄúCall mom at 5 PM tomorrow‚Äù)

### 3.4 Scheduling & Calendar
- Google Calendar integration (read/write)
- View daily/weekly agenda
- Drag-and-drop task planner (optional UI feature)

### 3.5 Notifications
- Reminders via email or push
- ‚ÄúNudge‚Äù notifications for procrastinated tasks

### 3.6 Reporting & Analytics
- Weekly productivity reports
- Task completion trends
- Best times of day for focus

## 7. AI Logic Overview

### Task Prioritization Scoring (Example Logic)

```python
priority_score = (
    urgency_weight * time_until_due +
    importance_weight * user_assigned_priority +
    duration_weight * estimated_time +
    pattern_weight * personal_productivity_patterns
)

Learning Model
Track task completion times

Adjust estimated duration

Model peak productivity hours

Feedback loop to improve scheduling predictions
